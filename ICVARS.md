由於近幾年硬件技術的提升，商用VR頭盔日益普及於社會當中，然而內容開發者對於人類在VR中的感知仍然理解不足，在沈浸式的內容創作中設計直觀的交互體驗是重要的。

The purpose of this study is to identify the degree of intuitive gesture manipulation that is experimented by two camera based and two sensor based devices.
To this end, we designed a data glove for intuitively playing a speed stacking game, and performed comparative analysis by examining the conditions through four devices.
Through the analytics, we confirmed that sensor based geture manipulation in VR is better while people need to rapid finish complex tasks.
This study is significant because it confirms that sensor based glove is suitable for the cases that we want to simulate real-life case into virtual environment.

### 1 INTRODUCTION

ACM's new manuscript submission template aims to provide consistent styles for use across ACM publications, and incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and SIG-specific templates have been examined, and their unique features incorporated into this single new template. If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and instruction into the current process for preparing` your manuscript.
This submission template allows authors to submit their papers for review to an ACM Conference or Journal without any output design specifications incorporated at this point in the process. The ACM "Submission Template" is a single column MS-Word document that allows authors to type their content into the pre-existing set of paragraph formatting styles applied to the sample placeholder text here, or copy-and-paste their text and then apply the respective paragraph styles (Windows: you can open the Styles task pane from the Home tab [it can also be opened with the keyboard shortcut Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S]; MAC16: you can access the Styles pane at the right of the Home toolbar.) Highlight a section that you want to designate with a certain style, and then select the appropriate style from the list. To view which style is being used in any part of this document, place your cursor on your text and look at the "Current style" field in the Styles pane.
It is beneficial to create your document in draft mode with the style panel open in the left-side panel. If the panel is not immediately visible when the Submission Template is opened, you will need to open the panel manually—for Windows: click on the following from the main ribbon above: File > Options > Advanced > Display > Style area pane width in Draft and Outline views. Set the style area width (1_1.5" is a good starting value.); for MAC: go to the "View" menu and select "Draft"; then go to the "Word" menu and select "Preferences" and then "View," under the "Window" section insert "1.5" inches under the style area width.
All style elements are specified in this template to facilitate the production of your paper and to have the styles consistent throughout. The paragraph styles are built-in and examples of the styles are provided throughout this document. Save as you go and backup your work regularly!
